        <h2><strong>Lets start off with some of my TOP 10 Albums (in a list element, no less...)</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>The Division Bell - Pink Floyd</h3>
                <img src="PF.png" alt="Devision Bell Cover Art" />
                <p>
                    I can't <em>believe</em> you're goint to read all this. Despite it being their last album (until 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dw8aFj5cwQ&list=PLRhGh_yxhgtGFra5MEubnEp99hXFIJg9S" target="_blank"><code>The Endless River</code></a> 
                    came out in 2014),
                    <br>this was actually the first Pink Floyd album I heard. Being a wee sprog I hadn't been exposed to psychdelic rock before,
                    <br>and withough waxing lyrical, it absolutely captivated me.
                </p>
                <p>As I grew older and got my first Ipod (which was so <b>thick</b> you could use it as a purging weapon), I started listening to
                    <br> more of their classic albums such as 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW-lXjOyUWo&list=PL3PhWT10BW3Urh8ZXXpuU9h526ChwgWKy" target="_blank"><code>The Dark Side of the Moon</code></a> and
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLFwTqdsuxw&list=PLyDzU3p8FP24syYfTXpGqTDHsQhlxwllS" target="_blank"><code>The Wall</code></a>
                    , but I always found myself leaning 
                    <br> towards the later Gilmour era of Pink Floyd - I guess I just prefered his bassy, calming tone? Don't get me wrong, I love 
                    <br>schreeching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrxX9TBj2zY" target="_blank"><code>"WE DON'T NEED NO EDUCATION"</code></a>
                    in my naff Southern accent as much as the next guy, but 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HLaOmiwV5Q&list=PLYe_yAiX89Y1Hbf5l6bcrMdscFDEBLx53" target="_blank"><code>The Division Bell</code></a> 
                    <br> will always be the definitive Pink Floyd sound to me...
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Brothers in Arms - Dire Straights</h3>
                <img src="DS.png" alt="Brothers in Arms Cover Art" />
                <p>Continuing on with the <q>Dad rock</q>, we have Dire Straight's definitive album 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M3MSbm13ps" target="_blank"><code>Brothers In Arms</code></a>. 
                    This record is so nostalgic, 
                    <br> taking me back to hearing it's 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-3qF8v9CTw" target="_blank"><code>title track</code></a>
                    for the first time during a holiday I was lucky enough to be on with the family. 
                </p>
                <p>This album has everything. Need a dose of optimism after a break-up? Try 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEIZcokwxfQ" target="_blank"><code>Why Worry?</code></a>
                    Fancy spicing things up a little with 
                    <br>some <sub>sweet</sub> <sup>sweet</sup> saxaphone?
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUZDkBjIPS0" target="_blank"><code>Your Latest Trick</code></a>
                    is the one for you. Wanna impress your friends by singing <q>WOO-HOO</q>
                    <br>at the wrong point in the song <mark>every. single. time?</mark> Then 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LZVRmAMdhU" target="_blank"><code>Walk of Life</code></a>

                </p>

            <li>
                <H3>Out Of The Blue - Electric Light Orchestra</H3>
                <img src="ELO3.png" alt="Out Of The Blue Cover Art"/>
                <p>Maybe <q>Top 10</q> is a little <em>too</em> far. This is a Stockholm syndrom kind of love. If I had a pound for every time this was played 
                    <br> on repeat in the confines of my Dad's car... <s>admittedly I'd only have about Â£16.</s> But rest assured, it was enough to hard wire
                    <br> every single lyric into my head like some kind of experimental 70's mind control.
                </p>
                <p>I gotta admit it though, this album is <strong>banger</strong> after <strong>banger</strong>. Hearing that deep synth creep in from a fade as the drums escalate 
                    <br>at the start of 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDhJU_cNCZE" target="_blank"><code>Turn to Stone</code></a>
                    gets me absolutely P U M P E D every time!
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0B3tEtpDWA" target="_blank"><code>Mr Blue Sky</code></a>
                    is an bona fide classic that everyone 
                    <br>can tap their foot to, the strings in 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNjrBUzXDJk" target="_blank"><code>Sweet Talkin' Woman</code></a>
                    are just &#128076;&#128076;&#128076;mwa magnifique; and let's be honest, if by time the
                    <br> album rolls to a close you find that you <em>HAVEN'T</em> cried at 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgbBy9hmZjA" target="_blank"><code>Wild West Hero</code></a>
                    , well... then you're probably dead inside...
